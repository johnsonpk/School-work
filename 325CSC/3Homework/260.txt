Ganesh is a level-headed, senior advocate while Vasanth is his flirtatious junior advocate. The Ganesh-Vasanth pair were similar to James Hadley Chase's characters, Vic Malloy and his sidekick. Ganesh was initially assisted by a female assistant Niraja, but later on he was paired with Vasanth. The exact ages of Ganesh and Vasanth were not mentioned by the author and they remain immortal in the minds of the readers. The ages of the duo are assumed to be in between late twenties and early thirties with Vasanth being few years younger than Ganesh. The marital status of the duo was also not mentioned in any of the novels. According to the last few interviews of the author in the early 2000s, Vasanth is still an eligible bachelor searching for a suitable bride for himself.

Ganesh is portrayed as a serious person while Vasanth is a jolly, social, yet an intelligent guy who lives as right-hand man to his boss Ganesh. Vasanth loves to flirt with women, trying to impress them, and he cracks adult jokes especially the famous mysterious and untold adult joke 'Mexico Salavaikkaari' (Mexican washerwoman), much against the likes of his senior. He is also shown as a brave guy who involves himself in dangerous stunts on his boss' instructions.

The novels were made into films and television shows where the character Ganesh is enacted by well known actors Rajnikanth in Priya (1978 film), Jaishankar in Gaayathri etc. A television series of the duo was broadcast where Ganesh and Vasanth were enacted by actors Suresh and Vijay Athiraj respectively.
